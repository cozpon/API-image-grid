# Flickr API Grab
- Built to use Flickr's public, search API to create a responsive image gallery.

## Getting Started:

### Clone to your local computer:
in a terminal window run:
```
git clone https://github.com/cozpon/Upthere_
```
cd into Upthere_ directory and run:

```
npm install
```
to install the node_modules


Then run:
```
npm start
```
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
Unfortunately The Flickr API doesn't support CORS.
A work-around is to enable CORS using this Google Chrome add-on:
